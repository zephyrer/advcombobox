This project is the continuation of the AdvComboBox project that can be found on The Code Project site.
I created that project back in September 2002 and the control is still being used. But it's not really open source at that place so I moved it here instead so everyone can pitch in to make this control what it should be.

Take a look at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/combobox/advcombobox.aspx for some history information.

I have looked at all comments regarding the control and added all reported bugs as issues here at Google Code.

If you want to help out with this control, just let me know.
